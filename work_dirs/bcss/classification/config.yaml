  text_prompts:
  - Tumor (TUM) regions consist of malignant epithelial cells characterized by pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei, loss of glandular structure, and frequent mitotic figures, representing the core cancerous lesions in breast tissue.
  - Stroma (STR) comprises the surrounding connective tissue, including fibroblasts and collagen fibers, often appearing as pink fibrous structures and sometimes showing desmoplastic reactions to tumor invasion.
  - Lymphocyte (LYM) regions contain dense clusters of small immune cells with dark, round nuclei and minimal cytoplasm, reflecting the host immune response within the tumor microenvironment.
  - Necrosis (NEC) represents areas of dead or dying tissue with pale, structureless eosinophilic regions, nuclear debris, and “ghost” cell remnants, typically associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor vascularization.
